## Sass Sourcemap Size Ratio

### Requirements

- Node
- Yarn

### Setup

`yarn && yarn run build && yarn run parse`

Try and write some dreadfull sass in the `scss` folder and observe the ratios in the output.

### Why

Trying some ideas how to identify scss partials that are generating way too much output.
